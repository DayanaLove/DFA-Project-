# DFA-Project-This program allows a user to input a deterministic finite automata as a text file following the format of "myDFA.txt". The program will then prompt the user to input the string they want to test, and will output the state changes along with whether the string is accepted or rejected. 

Format for text file:
Language {,}
States  {,}
Start State  {,}
Accept State  {,}
State Changes (,)->

*Look at text file for example of how to format exactly*
